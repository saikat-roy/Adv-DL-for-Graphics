## Assignment 1: Autoencoders
A simple autoencoder was trained using SGD on the MNIST dataset. The reconstruction after 20 iterations using 
Mean Squared Error Loss and Cross Entropy loss respectively are provided below for 2 random batches of size 64.

## Assignment 2: Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
DCGAN trained with different size of z on 5 classes of CIFAR-100. True and generated images with z=100 is provided below.
